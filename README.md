<h3>About me</h3>
<hr>

Hello, I'm Araz Schwarz. I'm from Russia, but right now living in TÃ¼rkiye. I'm former prosthodontic dentist with clinical experience about 5 years. Recently I started out learning Python, HTML, CSS and currently learning JavaScript with help of "The Odin Project" and other resources.
